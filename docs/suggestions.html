            <p>Status: </p><p class="considered">Considered</p><br />
            <p>The ability to call a command and have dice be rolled would be useful, but the bot only posts at a speed of once every 30 minutes, likely too slow for gameplay.</p>
            <p><em>Update 1 (Jul. 4, '21):</em> After checking pg. 20 of the topic, it looks like gameplay is surprisingly slow, with the average distance between rolls on pg. 20 being <em>1,248</em>.
                (Though this may not be accurate, as I measured the distance by hand.)</p>

            <p>Status: </p><p class="undecided">Undecided</p><br />
            <p>This could be useful, but would require a database or JSON file to keep track of reminders, and there's a risk of reminders being dropped due to crashes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="command">
            <div class="suggestion_num">S5</div>
            <pre>make the bot respond faster</pre><br />
            <p>Status: </p><p class="considered">Considered</p><br />
            <p>The current speed is quite slow, but this is to prevent inflating the view count of the threads, which is unavoidable with the way the bot gathers data.
                On average, the bot views around 2 or 3 pages per visit, though this could be increased by downtime or spikes in activity.</p><br />
            <p><em>Update 1 (Jul. 1, '21):</em> I've been thinking about it some more, and 2 or 3 pages is a really small number. It takes about 10 seconds to reload a page three times.
                If I do decrease the delay, it'll probably be to 15 or 20 minutes.</p>

            <p>Status: </p><p class="denied">Denied</p><br />
            <p>No. The way the bot's code is formatted right now is very incompatible with the format of a Discord bot, and would likely require completely restructureing the code to support this.</p>
