        <h3><em>A bot for the TBGs</em></h3>
        <br><br>
        <div class="command">
            <b>0.14.x</b>
            <div class="command">
                <pre>0.14.0</pre>
                <p>The time between parse-cycles can now be changed.<br />
                Changed the timing for the sixty-second rule from 62 seconds to 61.<br />
                <i>nh!estimate</i> now uses <i>code</i> instead of <i>quote</i>.<br />
                Updated <i>nh!help</i> to include <i>nh!rolladice</i> and <i>nh!choose</i>.<br />
                Fixed an issue where <i>nh!text</i>'s <i>read</i> and <i>create</i> subcommands failed to make log entries.<br />
                <i>nh!text</i> and <i>nh!files</i> now check for invalid characters in filenames.<br />
                Fixed an issue where <i>nh!text insert</i> didn't work.<br />
                If a command does not provide any output at all, a proper error message will be generated, rather than giving a string concatenation error.<br />
                Renamed <i>roll_a_dice.json</i> to <i>user_data.json</i>, in preperation for additional storing of user data.<br />
                Updated <i>nh!rolladice</i> to account for changes in the formatting of <i>user_data.json</i>.<br />
                The delays for rolling 2 and 10 in <i>nh!rolladice</i> are now measured in parse-cycle lengths, not hours.<br />
                Updated <i>commands.nihonium</i> to 1.9.1<br />
                Updated <i>commands.nh_rolladice</i> to 1.10.0<br />
                Updated <i>commands.nh_file_manip</i> to 1.9.0<br />
                Updated the Suggestions page.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="command">
            <b>0.13.x</b>
            <div class="command">
                <pre>0.13.0</pre>
                <p>The bot now has two version numbers; one for the original Nihonium install, and one for the current fork, if any.<br />
                Both version numbers are passed to commands, with the fork version number using "forkversion".<br />
                The fork version number is now used in most places where the Nihonium version number was used before.<br />
                Updated <i>commands.nihonium</i> to 1.9.0</p>
            </div>

            <div class="command">
                <pre>0.12.6</pre>
                <p>If <i>pass.txt</i> doesn't exist, the bot will ask for a password.<br />
                If the bot fails to log in, it will now gracefully exit instead of crashing, while also telling the user to check the password.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="command">
                <pre>0.12.5</pre>
                <p>The motd is no longer printed to the log, as the motd seems to be unrelated to the crash.<br />
                If a <i>requests.exceptions.ConnectionError</i> occurs while the bot is initially trying to scrape the thread, it will try again up to 3 times.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="command">
                <pre>0.12.4</pre>
                <p>Added a filter system to prevent specific users from using commands, meant to make it so that bots can choose not to respond to other bots.<br />
                Made it so that, when the signature is updated, the motd is printed on the log, as an attempt to debug a random crash that can occur sometimes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="command">
                <pre>0.12.3</pre>

                Moved several strings to an external file (<i>botinfo.json</i>), for ease of customizability.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="command">
                <pre>0.12.0</pre>
                <p>Commands can now return the empty string to act as if they were invalid.<br />
                Commands can now make log entries.<br />
                Updated <i>commands.nh_rolladice</i> to 1.9.0<br />
                When an exception occurs during a command, the traceback is now printed in the log.<br />
                Made it so that you can no longer make more than five rolls using <i>nh!rolladice</i> in one parse-cycle.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="command">
